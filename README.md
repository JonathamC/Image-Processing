# Object Detection and Evaluation

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains a Python script for object detection in a scene using the OpenCV library. The script uses the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) feature detector and descriptor to identify objects in a given scene. Additionally, it provides evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy for the detected objects.

## Contents

1. **Scripts:**
   - `object_detection.py`: The main script for object detection and evaluation.
   
2. **Images:**
   - `Scenes`: Contains example scene images.
   - `Objects`: Contains example object images.
   - `Detected_Objects`: Contains images with detected objects outlined.
   - `Matches`: Contains images visualizing keypoint matches.
   - `Keypoints`: Contains images with keypoints marked.

3. **How to Use:**
   - Ensure you have OpenCV and NumPy installed in your Python environment.
   - Run the script `object_detection.py` by providing the paths to scene and object images.
   - Adjust parameters in the script, such as the ORB parameters and matching threshold, for optimal results.

4. **Results:**
   - The script outputs evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
   - Detected objects are outlined in the scene images, and keypoint matches are visualized.

5. **Examples:**
   - Example images are provided in the `Scenes` and `Objects` directories.
   - Results of object detection are saved in the `Detected_Objects` directory.
   - Matching visualizations and keypoints are saved in the `Matches` and `Keypoints` directories.

6. **Note:**
   - Ensure that the scene and object images are appropriately named and located.
   - Experiment with ORB parameters and matching thresholds for different scenarios.
   - The script provides a foundation for object detection and evaluation, and customization is encouraged based on specific use cases.

7. **Dependencies:**
   - Python 3.x
   - OpenCV
   - NumPy
   - scikit-learn

8. **Contributing:**
   - Contributions are welcome. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.
